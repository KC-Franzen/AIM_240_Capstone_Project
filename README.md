# AIM_240_Capstone_Project
This project is focused on building a Chatbot that can assess a user's depth on knowledge on physics from physics-based questions.
There is a working model for classifying the user's sentence as displacement, Energy, and non-physics text.
You will find the source code for cleaning displacement text, energy text, and generic text.
You will find clean data sets of all three text and a combined clean data set used for training the regession model.
You will fnd the code for the regression model, along with the saved regression model.
The displacement text has text from OpenStax, an APA reference of the used is provided. 
All other text used is generated from ChatOpenAI.com, "ChatGPT 3.5".
