# AIM_240_Capstone_Project
Inspiration for Project:
This project is focused on building a Chatbot that can assess a user's depth of knowledge on physics from physics-based questions.
This project is inspired by providing an alternative method of assessing proficiency level in an educational setting in constrast to standard-based assessment.
Students will recieve immediate feedback on proficiency level of content.

Learning Experience: 
One of the main challenges was designing and effective mthodology for assesing depth a knowledge based on user reposne to physics concepts. I started small with topics of displacement and energy. I started with building a model that can identfy physic concepts. I built a working regression model that can classify sentences that are describing concepts of displacement, and energy. I have a deeper understand how NLP is used in identify text. 

Content Found in Project
There is a working model for classifying the user's sentence as displacement, Energy, and non-physics text.
You will find the source code for cleaning displacement text, energy text, and generic text.
You will find clean data sets of all three text and a combined clean data set used for training the regession model.
You will fnd the code for the regression model, along with the saved regression model.
The displacement text has text from OpenStax, an APA reference of the used is provided. 
All other text used is generated from ChatOpenAI.com, "ChatGPT 3.5".

Future Enhancements
Additonal features for the chatbot will be added in the near future. Chatbot features needs to be added. Opoen source libraries of ChatGTP 2.0 is being explored to expand on the content knowledge of physics, and give a more dynamic range of understanding abstract concepts that provides examples of physics topics. Future additions into the project will be looked at to provide scoring users response to quesitons, and having dynamic questioning to have different depths of knowledge questions for more accurcay in assessing a student's depth of knowledge.
