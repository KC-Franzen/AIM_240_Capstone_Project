Unless you have flown in an airplane, you have probably never traveled faster than 150 mph. Can you imagine traveling in a train like the one shown in that goes over 300 mph? Despite the high speed, the people riding in this train may not notice that they are moving at all unless they look out the window! This is because motion, even motion at 300 mph, is relative to the observer.
In this chapter, you will learn why it is important to identify a reference frame in order to clearly describe motion. For now, the motion you describe will be one-dimensional. Within this context, you will learn the difference between distance and displacement as well as the difference between speed and velocity. Then you will look at some graphing and problem-solving techniques. Our study of physics opens with kinematics—the study of motion without considering its causes. Objects are in motion everywhere you look. Everything from a tennis game to a space-probe flyby of the planet Neptune involves motion. When you are resting, your heart moves blood through your veins. Even in inanimate objects, atoms are always moving.
How do you know something is moving? The location of an object at any particular time is its position. More precisely, you need to specify its position relative to a convenient reference frame. Earth is often used as a reference frame, and we often describe the position of an object as it relates to stationary objects in that reference frame. For example, a rocket launch would be described in terms of the position of the rocket with respect to Earth as a whole, while a professor’s position could be described in terms of where she is in relation to the nearby white board. In other cases, we use reference frames that are not stationary but are in motion relative to Earth. To describe the position of a person in an airplane, for example, we use the airplane, not Earth, as the reference frame. Thus, you can only know how fast and in what direction an object's position is changing against a background of something else that is either not moving or moving with a known speed and direction. The reference frame is the coordinate system from which the positions of objects are described.
Your classroom can be used as a reference frame. In the classroom, the walls are not moving. Your motion as you walk to the door, can be measured against the stationary background of the classroom walls. You can also tell if other things in the classroom are moving, such as your classmates entering the classroom or a book falling off a desk. You can also tell in what direction something is moving in the classroom. You might say, “The teacher is moving toward the door.” Your reference frame allows you to determine not only that something is moving but also the direction of motion.
You could also serve as a reference frame for others’ movement. If you remained seated as your classmates left the room, you would measure their movement away from your stationary location. If you and your classmates left the room together, then your perspective of their motion would be change. You, as the reference frame, would be moving in the same direction as your other moving classmates. As you will learn in the Snap Lab, your description of motion can be quite different when viewed from different reference frames.
The idea that a description of motion depends on the reference frame of the observer has been known for hundreds of years. The 17th-century astronomerGalileoGalilei was one of the first scientists to explore this idea. Galileo suggested the following thought experiment: Imagine a windowless ship moving at a constant speed and direction along a perfectly calm sea. Is there a way that a person inside the ship can determine whether the ship is moving? You can extend this thought experiment by also imagining a person standing on the shore. How can a person on the shore determine whether the ship is moving?
Galileo came to an amazing conclusion. Only by looking at each other can a person in the ship or a person on shore describe the motion of one relative to the other. In addition, their descriptions of motion would be identical. A person inside the ship would describe the person on the land as moving past the ship. The person on shore would describe the ship and the person inside it as moving past. Galileo realized that observers moving at a constant speed and direction relative to each other describe motion in the same way. Galileo had discovered that a description of motion is only meaningful if you specify a reference frame.
As we study the motion of objects, we must first be able to describe the object’s position. Before your parent drives you to school, the car is sitting in your driveway. Your driveway is the starting position for the car. When you reach your high school, the car has changed position. Its new position is your school. Physicists use variables to represent terms. We will use d to represent car’s position. We will use a subscript to differentiate between the initial position, d0, and the final position, df. In addition, vectors, which we will discuss later, will be in bold or will have an arrow above the variable. Scalars will be italicized. Now imagine driving from your house to a friend's house located several kilometers away. How far would you drive? The distance an object moves is the length of the path between its initial position and its final position. The distance you drive to your friend's house depends on your path. Distance is different from the length of a straight line between two points. The distance you drive to your friend's house is probably longer than the straight line between the two houses.
We often want to be more precise when we talk about position. The description of an object’s motion often includes more than just the distance it moves. For instance, if it is a five kilometer drive to school, the distance traveled is 5 kilometers. After dropping you off at school and driving back home, your parent will have traveled a total distance of 10 kilometers. The car and your parent will end up in the same starting position in space. The net change in position of an object is its displacement, or The Greek letter delta, meanschange in.
If you are describing only your drive to school, then the distance traveled and the displacement are the same—5 kilometers. When you are describing the entire round trip, distance and displacement are different. When you describe distance, you only include the magnitude, the size or amount, of the distance traveled. However, when you describe the displacement, you take into account both the magnitude of the change in position and the direction of movement.
In our previous example, the car travels a total of 10 kilometers, but it drives five of those kilometers forward toward school and five of those kilometers back in the opposite direction. If we ascribe the forward direction a positive (+) and the opposite direction a negative (–), then the two quantities will cancel each other out when added together. A quantity, such as distance, that has magnitude (i.e., how big or how much) but does not take into account direction is called a scalar. A quantity, such as displacement, that has both magnitude and direction is called a vector.
Hopefully you now understand the conceptual difference between distance and displacement. Understanding concepts is half the battle in physics. The other half is math. A stumbling block to new physics students is trying to wade through the math of physics while also trying to understand the associated concepts. This struggle may lead to misconceptions and answers that make no sense. Once the concept is mastered, the math is far less confusing. So let’s review and see if we can make sense of displacement in terms of numbers and equations. You can calculate an object's displacement by subtracting its original position, d0, from its final position df. In math terms that means delta displacement equals final position minus its original position. If the final position is the same as the initial position, then change in displacement is equal to zero. 
To assign numbers and/or direction to these quantities, we need to define an axis with a positive and a negative direction. We also need to define an origin, or O. The axis is in a straight line with home at zero and school in the positive direction. If we left home and drove the opposite way from school, motion would have been in the negative direction. We would have assigned it a negative value. In the round-trip drive, df and d0 were both at zero kilometers. In the one way trip to school, df was at 5 kilometers and d0 was at zero km. So, was 5 kilometers.
The displacement is negative because we chose east to be positive and west to be negative. We could also have described the displacement as 1 km west. When calculating displacement, the direction mattered, but when calculating distance, the direction did not matter. The problem would work the same way if the problem were in the north–south or y-direction.
Displacement is defined as the vector quantity that describes the change in position of an object or a point in space. It is characterized by both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. Displacement is typically measured from an initial position to a final position, with the direction pointing from the initial point to the final point. The magnitude of displacement represents the shortest distance between the initial and final positions, often calculated using distance formulas such as the Pythagorean theorem in two or three dimensions.
Displacement is closely related to distance, another important quantity in physics. While distance measures the total length traveled by an object along a path, displacement specifically refers to the change in position from the starting point to the ending point, regardless of the path taken. As a result, displacement can be equal to or less than the distance traveled, depending on the path's direction and curvature. In scenarios where an object moves in a straight line, displacement and distance are equal, but in cases involving curved paths or changes in direction, they may differ.
Displacement plays a central role in describing the motion of objects and particles in physics. It provides a concise and precise way to characterize the spatial changes undergone by an object during its motion. By tracking the displacement of an object over time, physicists can analyze its velocity, acceleration, and other kinematic properties. Displacement vectors can be added or subtracted to represent complex motion scenarios, such as changes in direction or velocity. In combination with time measurements, displacement enables the creation of position-time graphs and the calculation of velocity and acceleration profiles.
In classical mechanics and dynamics, displacement serves as a fundamental quantity for analyzing the motion of particles and objects under the influence of forces. Newton's laws of motion, for example, relate the displacement of an object to the forces acting upon it, providing a framework for predicting and understanding the behavior of mechanical systems. Displacement vectors are used to describe the translational motion of objects in three-dimensional space, allowing for the precise calculation of trajectories, velocities, and accelerations. In engineering and technology, displacement measurements are essential for designing and optimizing systems ranging from vehicles and machinery to electronic devices and structures.
Displacement vectors are an integral part of vector calculus and multivariable analysis, where they are used to describe changes in position, velocity, and acceleration in multidimensional spaces. In these mathematical frameworks, displacement vectors are manipulated using vector operations such as addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication. Displacement gradients and fluxes play a crucial role in the study of vector fields, fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and other areas of physics and engineering.
Displacement is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. This distinguishes it from scalar quantities like distance, which only have magnitude. As a vector, displacement follows the rules of vector algebra, including vector addition and subtraction. For example, if an object moves from point A to point B and then to point C, its total displacement is the vector sum of the displacements from A to B and from B to C.
In the study of motion, displacement can be analyzed over different time intervals. Instantaneous displacement refers to the change in position of an object at a specific instant in time, typically represented by a vector tangent to the object's path at that moment. Average displacement, on the other hand, is the overall change in position over a given time interval, calculated by dividing the total displacement by the duration of the interval.
Displacement is not limited to one-dimensional motion but extends to two-dimensional and three-dimensional scenarios as well. In two dimensions, displacement vectors have both horizontal and vertical components, while in three dimensions, they have three components along the x, y, and z axes. Displacement in multiple dimensions allows for the analysis of complex motion patterns, such as projectile motion or the motion of objects in curved paths.
Displacement-time graphs are graphical representations that depict an object's displacement as a function of time. In these graphs, the displacement is plotted on the vertical axis, while time is plotted on the horizontal axis. The slope of the displacement-time graph represents the object's velocity, with steeper slopes indicating higher velocities. Additionally, the area under the displacement-time curve represents the total displacement traveled by the object over the given time interval.
Displacement is a fundamental concept in the fields of kinematics and dynamics, where it serves as a key parameter for describing the motion of objects under the influence of forces. In kinematics, displacement is used to calculate velocity and acceleration, providing insights into how objects move over time. In dynamics, displacement vectors are essential for applying Newton's laws of motion, which relate the forces acting on an object to its resulting motion and displacement.
Displacement measurements have numerous practical applications across various fields, including navigation, engineering, and geosciences. In navigation, GPS devices use displacement vectors to determine the position and movement of vehicles and pedestrians. In engineering, displacement sensors are used to measure the movement of mechanical components in machines and structures. In geosciences, displacement data help monitor seismic activity and assess the risk of earthquakes and landslides.
An object moving along a straight line from point A to point B undergoes displacement equal to the vector difference between the final position (B) and the initial position (A).
For instance, a car traveling along a highway moves 100 meters east from its starting point, resulting in a displacement of +100 meters in the eastward direction.
A projectile, such as a baseball or a launched rocket, experiences displacement as it moves through the air under the influence of gravity.
During its flight, the projectile undergoes horizontal displacement due to its initial velocity and vertical displacement due to the effect of gravity.
For example, a cannonball fired at an angle experiences both horizontal and vertical displacements as it travels through the air before hitting the ground.
An object undergoing circular motion, such as a planet orbiting a star or a car navigating a curved track, experiences displacement despite not moving in a straight line.
The displacement vector points from the object's initial position to its final position, tracing the curved path it follows.
For instance, a satellite orbiting Earth experiences displacement as it completes each orbit around the planet, despite its circular trajectory.
In oscillatory or vibrational motion, objects undergo back-and-forth displacement around a central position or equilibrium point.
For example, a pendulum swinging back and forth exhibits displacement as it moves from one extreme position to the other, passing through its equilibrium position.
Waves, such as sound waves, water waves, or electromagnetic waves, propagate through a medium by causing particles to undergo displacement.
In a transverse wave, particles of the medium oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation, resulting in displacement perpendicular to the wave's motion.
For instance, as a water wave travels across a pond, water particles move up and down, experiencing displacement perpendicular to the direction of wave travel.
When a solid material, such as a spring or a rubber band, is subjected to a force, it undergoes displacement due to elastic deformation.
The displacement of the material is proportional to the applied force, as described by Hooke's Law for elastic materials.
For example, stretching a rubber band causes it to elongate, resulting in displacement along its length proportional to the applied force.
